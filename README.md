# Project 2

# Topic: Entertainment & Sports

## Group: Angie, Judy, Dylan

## Our Idea

We think that the Staples Center, located in downtown Los Angeles, is a hotspot for crime in Los Angeles. The influx of thousands of people from all over the world to a venue that hosts the Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and countless concerts seems like the type of place that would attract petty theft and other types of crime, as many of the people attending these events are not familiar with the areas surrounding the arena, and where to stay away from. Our goal would be to show that there are more crime events in the areas immediately surrounding the Staples Center, when compared to other areas within a 2-3 mile radius of the arena. 

## How would we do this?

We have a data set from the city of LA that lists every crime event that has occurred from 2010 - Present. The data set has an API that we would call to find crime events in the locations surrounding the Staples Center specifically. The link is below.

## What are our visualizations?

Our goal would be to have three different visualizations to prove that the Staples Center either does or doesn’t have an effect on crime rates by bringing tens of thousands of people to events over the course of last year.

1. A histogram of a single event over each hour of the day - Did reported crime events spike at the time of the selected event?
2. Show the averages of crime data on days that do and don’t have an event to prove that the event is causing the crime, and the area isn’t just dangerous in general.
3. Choropleth of crime events in the areas surrounding Downtown LA. Does this map show that crime goes down the farther you get from the Staples Center. 
4. Another idea - We could compare the Staples Center to a couple of other venues in the LA area, and see if this is a trend, proving that entertainment & sports events do attract more crime than other areas that don’t have large venues.


# Project 2

Your task is to tell a story through data visualizations.
Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 
Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.
You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly.
You will have ample time in class to work with your group, but expect to put in hours outside of class as well. 


# Specific Requirements
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 
- A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
