Based on our research and visualizations, we did not confirm our hypothesis that there is more crime surrounding the three arenas. 
The geo-mapped view shows that there is a relatively even spread of crime near the arenas, with small pockets of lower crime events, and small pockets of higher crime events in downtown LA. 
Visually we can spot that there is a smaller amount of crime surrounding the Coliseum. 
This could be because of its close proximity to the private institution of the University of Southern California; this university maintains tight security surrounding its campus. 
From the map, it is hard to conclude that there is higher crime near the arenas, but there is a visible trend on the line plot in which reported crimes appear to increase the farther one gets from each of the arenas. 
This is the opposite of our hypothesis.

There are many reasons why these arenas would not lead to an increase in crimes committed. 
For one, there is likely increased security and police surveillance for each of the arenas, even on days when there are not events. 
Also, all three areas where these arenas are located have experienced gentrification to varying extents over the past few years. 
The influx of new, wealthier residents into this area has likely also led to decreased crime rates around each arena.
